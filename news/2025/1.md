Elon Musk (leads an offer)牵头了一项收购协议 to buy ChatGPT's parent company for nearly $100 billion.
In a (high-stakes bid)高风险竞标 that could reshape the future of artificial intelligence, Elon Musk is leading a group of investors who have offered to buy OpenAl, the parent company of ChatGPT, for $97.4 billion.
Musk has (long feuded with)长期争执 OpenAl CEO Sam Altman and has filed a number of legal complaints against the company and Altman, claiming that the Al company and its leadership have (misrepresented)错误的描述 OpenAl as a philanthropy(慈善机构).
Musk claims that OpenAl has （broken with its founding charter)偏离了创业初衷 by seeking to make a profit with its Al tools.
OpenAl is operated by a nonprofit that controls an entity called OpenAl LP, a （for-profit)盈利 company that exists within the larger company's structure.
That for-profit company took OpenAl from (effectively worthless)几乎没有任何价值 to a valuation估值 of around $100 billion in just a few years - and Altman is largely credited as the mastermind of that plan and the key to the company's success.
In response, Altman said in a post on X, "no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want." Musk, who (co-founded)共同创业 OpenAl in 2015, has since left离开 (over a dispute)由于争端 related to the company's shift to for-profit work.
